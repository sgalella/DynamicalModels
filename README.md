#### Conway's Game of Life

The Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automata,in which each cell is depicted either alive or white dead. The rules are the following:
1. If a living cell has 2 or 3 living neighbors, survives.
2. If a dead cell has 3 living neighbors, revives.
3. Otherwise the cell dies.
